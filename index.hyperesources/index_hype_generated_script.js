You remain in my thoughts, almost everyday, and all I want is a rest. I just don\u2019t want to dwell on this anymore. Everyday I build my resolve and push on, yet I see you and my head starts falling short. Our hands as far away from each other as they can be. Our eyes wary of meeting the opposite gaze. Our feet wandering away from each other's path. We do our best to stay out of each other\u2019s way, yet\u2026 yet I know that we want to be in peace with each other, I\u2019ve always known that, but I won't give in, and I know you won't either, what's more; I count on you not to.</div><div><br></div><div>You were never the right one for me. You professed your longing for someone else while I asked for kiss on your departure, you never did kiss me when you went away. You hurt me. You made me feel worthless. You made me a side dish, yet\u2026 yet I\u2019ve forgiven you for these things and never thought to even hold a grudge.</div><div><br></div><div>I had so many damn pictures of you in my phone and I kept them there for so long. When I sat down to cleanse my camera roll and I had rounded up our pictures and videos a strange melancholy took over me, mainly triggered since our memories were less than 8 GB. I wonder how many pictures of me you had on your phone, I remember how you took them in the moments where I least expected it, and the thought of you still having them willingly in your gallery brings me such a heartache. I felt afraid of writing that\u2026 but I knew it was the word that had to be there.</div><div><br></div><div>Its silly and indulgent to dwell on these things, yet\u2026 yet I can\u2019t put a stop to it, maybe I don\u2019t want to let you go completely, I mean\u2026 if I\u2019ve already let you go in the outside world, why can\u2019t I keep you here in me?</div><div><br></div><div>So many things we did\u2026 how unexpected was it for us to be somewhat together. No one would\u2019ve thought of us being a thing\u2026 and I loved that, honestly. The fact that we became something serendipitous after having been next to each other for years and sharing nothing but polite \u201chi\u201ds and \u201cbye\u201ds. I never saw any particular trait in you that drove me to \u201cget\u201d you, however, once I got to talk with you\u2026 and we kept on talking, I just felt something different. It wasn\u2019t love, I know that much\u2026 but you made me feel something weird, something nice and the idea that I made you feel the same makes tremble. I really wish I didn\u2019t tear up sometimes, but I won\u2019t let the tear fall.</div><div><br></div><div>I\u2019m supposed to be over this, and I am, until I come home, eat and shut the lights, then\u2026 that\u2019s the moment you come in and wreak your eyes upon me, making me feel like a weak idiot. I\u2019m trying to be better every day. I remember those times where there was a \u201cyou-shaped\u201d hole in the middle of my lonely thoughts and now it's mostly gone, yet\u2026 yet some part remains there, its just that that hole shrinks every day, I guess that what varies is its density and not its area, which is why it can hurt more some days than others.</div><div><br></div><div>I need you to be a stranger to me again, and some day it will happen... and I dread it.</div>",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:1,aS:8,aT:8,a:509,b:243},"23":{c:2119,bS:45,d:1894,I:"Solid",cY:"0",e:1,J:"Solid",K:"Solid",g:"#000",L:"Solid",M:1,N:1,A:"#D8DDE4",j:"absolute",x:"visible",B:"#D8DDE4",P:1,O:1,C:"#D8DDE4",z:3,k:"div",D:"#D8DDE4",a:-59,b:-40}}}],{},h,{},null,false,true,-1,true,true,false,true,true);d[f]=c.API;document.getElementById(g).setAttribute("HYP_dn",f);c.z_o(this.body)})();})();
