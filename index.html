		<div>something weird, something nice</div>
		<div>Kenneth Vedder, 2020</div>
		<div>Why can’t I just let you go? You remain in my thoughts, almost everyday, and all I want is a rest. I just don’t want to dwell on this anymore. Everyday I build my resolve and push on, yet I see you and my head starts falling short. Our hands as far away from each other as they can be. Our eyes wary of meeting the opposite gaze. Our feet wandering away from each other's path. We do our best to stay out of each other’s way, yet… yet I know that we want to be in peace with each other, I’ve always known that, but I won't give in, and I know you won't either, what's more; I count on you not to.

You were never the right one for me. You professed your longing for someone else while I asked for a kiss on your departure, you never did kiss me when you went away. You hurt me. You made me feel worthless. You made me a side dish, yet… yet I’ve forgiven you for these things and never thought to even hold a grudge.

I had so many damn pictures of you in my phone and I kept them there for so long. When I sat down to cleanse my camera roll and I had rounded up our pictures and videos a strange melancholy took over me, mainly triggered since our memories were less than 8 GB. I wonder how many pictures of me you had on your phone, I remember how you took them in the moments where I least expected it, and the thought of you still having them willingly in your gallery brings me such a heartache. I felt afraid of writing that… but I knew it was the word that had to be there.

Its silly and indulgent to dwell on these things, yet… yet I can’t put a stop to it, maybe I don’t want to let you go completely, I mean… if I’ve already let you go in the outside world, why can’t I keep you here in me?

So many things we did… how unexpected was it for us to be somewhat together. No one would’ve thought of us being a thing… and I loved that, honestly. The fact that we became something serendipitous after having been next to each other for years and sharing nothing but polite “hi”s and “bye”s. I never saw any particular trait in you that drove me to “get” you, however, once I got to talk with you… and we kept on talking, I just felt something different. It wasn’t love, I know that much… but you made me feel something weird, something nice and the idea that I made you feel the same makes tremble. I really wish I didn’t tear up sometimes, but I won’t let the tear fall.

I’m supposed to be over this, and I am, until I come home, eat and shut the lights, then… that’s the moment you come in and wreak your eyes upon me, making me feel like a weak idiot. I’m trying to be better every day. I remember those times where there was a “you-shaped” hole in the middle of my lonely thoughts and now it's mostly gone, yet… yet some part remains there, its just that that hole shrinks every day, I guess that what varies is its density and not its area, which is why it can hurt more some days than others.

I need you to be a stranger to me again, and some day it will happen... and I dread it.
